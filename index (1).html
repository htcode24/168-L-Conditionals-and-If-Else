    <h1>168/L Conditionals and If Else Assignment</h1>
    <h2>By: Hillary Tran</h2>
    <p>In this assignment, I was tasked with writing code in Javascript for a program to calculate the change to be dispensed from a vending machine.
    <br>The vending machine only accepts a single dollar bill.
    <br> The items in the machine cost between 5 cents and 1 dollar, in 5-cent increments (5, 10, 20, 25, 30, 35, . . . 90, 95, or 100).
